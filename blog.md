### üó®Ô∏è&nbsp; "How does the video inform your understanding of human centered data science?"  
_In at least 2-3 full sentences, answer the question "How does the video inform your understanding of human centered data science?"._
There is a Video?? Research ethics plays a fundamental role, especially when publishing an algorithm in legal areas. The system must be transparent and decisions must be easily verifiable. This algorithm has been a perfect example of how discrimination against women in the labor market is beeing increased if ethical aspects and  are not considered properly. Even if such an algorithm only serves as a decision-making aid for human counsellors, it must be ensured that the computer's judgements would become irrevocable in practice in order not to further cement discrimination.

### ‚ùì&nbsp; Questions
_Using full sentences, list at least one question that this video raised in your mind, and say why it caused you to ask this question_

1. Is there a way to scientifically prove the impartiality of such an algorithm? Can we demolish the boundary between empirical observations and questionable decisions and categorizations of the system?
1. More transparency inevitably means a longer development time. When is a system transparent enough to be free of prejudices and bias? 
1. How to take the pressure off the development team in order to enable the selection of suitable data as the basis of bigger data science projects?

### Reflections and implications

Write about `350` words, reflecting on what you have learned, what you found, what (if anything) surprised üò≤ you about your findings, and/or what theories you have about why any biases might exist (if you find they exist). Please also include any questions this assignment raised for you about bias, Wikipedia, or machine learning.

    * _answer_
1. What might your results suggest about the internet and global society in general?
    * _answer_
1. Can you think of a realistic data science research situation where using these data (to train a model, perform a hypothesis-driven research, or make business decisions) might create biased or misleading results, due to the inherent gaps and limitations of the data?
    * _answer_
1. Can you think of a realistic data science research situation where using these data (to train a model, perform a hypothesis-driven research, or make business decisions) might still be appropriate and useful, despite its inherent limitations and biases?
    * _answer_
1. How might a researcher supplement or transform this dataset to potentially correct for the limitations/biases you observed?
    * _answer_
